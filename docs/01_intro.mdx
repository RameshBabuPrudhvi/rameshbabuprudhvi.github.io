# Introduction

Selcukes is an open source library that aims to build high-quality and highly scalable automated tests

## Features
- Easy add new logic to your tests without causing regression issues. Control the whole execution workflow - change browsers or reuse them. Retry your failing tests to make sure that there is a real problem.
- Automate UI actions or user scenarios on real devices or emulators with Selcukes features from test creation to execution.
- Cross-platform screenshot and video recording on test failure

## Getting Started

### What you need to start

#### Java 11

Test Automation is a development activity, so you will need some familiarity with Java.
Selcukes uses Java 11, so make sure you have a [JDK 11 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.

#### IDE

You will need a modern IDE to work with Java.
We recommend IntelliJ (you can download the Community Edition, which is free, [from here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).
But Eclipse will work fine as well.

#### A Build Tool

You will also need a build tool, either Gradle or Maven, to run your tests and generate your reports.
Make sure you have either [Gradle 3.x or higher](http://www.gradle.org/downloads) or [Maven 3.3.x or higher](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed.

### Quick Start
The quickest way to create a new project is to take one of the starter projects on Github.
You can find the starter project for TestNG at https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton[selcukes-java-skeleton].

You can clone this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton.git
cd selcukes-java-skeleton
```


Or simply [download a zip file from here](https://github.com/selcukes/selcukes-java-skeleton/archive/master.zip).

If you are using Maven, you can also create a new project using one of the Selcukes [Maven Archetypes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html).

#### So far so good?

The starter project comes with a demo test that you can run.
From the command line, run either

```shell
$ mvn clean verify
```

or

```shell
$ gradle clean test
```
